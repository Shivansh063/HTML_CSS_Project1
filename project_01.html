	<p>A recurrence for the running time of a divide-and-conquer algorithm falls out
from the three steps of the basic paradigm. As before, we let T .n/ be the running
time on a problem of size n. If the problem size is small enough, say n ! c
for some constant c, the straightforward solution takes constant time, which we
write as ‚.1/. Suppose that our division of the problem yields a subproblems,
each of which is 1=b the size of the original.</p>
